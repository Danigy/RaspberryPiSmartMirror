# RaspberryPi3-B+ SmartMirror
A smart mirror created with a raspberry pi 3 b+ and ASP.NET MVC5, using Mono installed on the pi and Filezilla for FTP.

# About The Project
I will be posting updates throughout the development of this project on my website www.zackaltom.com
There I will describe the steps I took from start to finish and provide any information that I think would be useful for someone to replicate the project.
Feel free to get a copy of the code and mess around with it, or even apply it to your own smart mirror. Any insights into possible improvements that can be made
in the code, or comments on functionality that you think would be cool to implement are welcomed and will be considered.  

# Important
I plan to expand on the project every so often and I may even add some aspects of machine learning to the smart mirror. To get a full list of current 
and future capabilities of the system, please view the Design folder and locate the subfolder labeled Requirements, look around at the diagrams in this folder,
or visit the website for more detailed explanations.
